   - Displays an interactive map with markers and routes.
   - Highlights pathways between selected starting and destination points.

2. **Customizable Location Resources:**
   - Dynamically loads and manages GeoJSON files to represent buildings and pathways.

3. **Dynamic Widgets for Interaction:**
   - Selectors for start and target locations allow for easy navigation through a user-friendly widget interface.

4. **Pathway Visualization:**
   - Shows animated paths using `folium.plugins.AntPath` for a clear and visually appealing route.

5. **Building Highlighting:**
   - Displays the outline of the target building to help users orient themselves better.
